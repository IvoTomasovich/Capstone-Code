However, the provided data is not a JSON array but a string containing multiple JSON objects. Here's how to extract the starting times:

```python
import json

# Assuming the given string is stored in a variable named data_str
data = json.loads(data_str)

starting_times = []
for obj in data:
    starting_times.append(obj[""start""])

print(starting_times)
```

The output will be a list of starting times in seconds. To convert these seconds to minutes and hours, you can use the `datetime` module:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

# Convert seconds to minutes and hours (assuming ""start"" is a list of seconds)
minutes_hours = [timedelta(seconds=s).total_seconds() // 60 for s in starting_times]
print(minutes_hours)
